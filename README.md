This file contains my password manager. The password manager is capable of importing reading and exporting json files. 
It has a main login screen to access your passwords where you can then input your own passwords username and the website name. You can then click the save function to save this information to your json file.
It also has a generate password function that will generate a random password of great strength for you to use if you can't come up with one of your own.
When you enter in your passwords the password manager will rate the strength of your password allowing you to know if your password is weak and worth changing.
When you enter in password and username it will display the username website and password.
You can delete passwords that are in the file by clicking on the delete.
It also has a log out feature so that you can log out when you have viewed your passwords and usernames.
